# SpectX query_pack
Public query package for SpectX

## Install
1) Here on GitHub click green button "Code" -> "Download ZIP"
2) Go to your SpectX (you can get it from https://www.spectx.com/get-spectx)
    * Right click on folder "user"
    * Select "Upload"
    * Click "Upload zip archive or single file"
    * Select downloaded file "query_pack-master.zip"
    * Done

## Ok, but how do I use it?
1) Double click on '/user/query_pack-master/apache/query_hits_by_status_range.sx'
2) Click on "Run" or use keyboard shortcut "Ctrl+E"
3) Click on "Chart" or use keyboard shortcut "Ctrl+H"

## Your demo data is boring, I need to analyze my own data!
1) Check files in '/user/query_pack-master/apache/view/'
2) Point to your data on local or remote storage (change file view_default.sx)
3) Enjoy
