# SpectX query_pack
Public query package for SpectX

## Install
1) Click the green button "Code" here in Github -> "Download ZIP"
2) Open your SpectX (get it from https://www.spectx.com/get-spectx)
    * Right-click on the "/user" folder in the left resource tree
    * Select "Upload"
    * Click "Upload zip archive or single file"
    * Select downloaded file "query_pack-master.zip"
    * Done

## Ok, but how do I use it?
1) Double-click on '/user/query_pack-master/apache/query_hits_by_status_range.sx'
2) Click on "**Run**" or use the keyboard shortcut "**Ctrl+E**"
3) Click on "**Chart**" or use the keyboard shortcut "**Ctrl+H**"
4) Repeat steps 1 to 3 with different scripts.

## Your demo data is boring, I need to analyze my own data!
1) Check the files in '/user/query_pack-master/apache/view/'
2) Point to your data on local or remote storage 
   * Change the file path after the LIST command in the view_default.sx file
   * To access remote storage, click on  "**New**" in the upper menu and select "Data Store"
3) Enjoy
4) In the code editor "**Ctrl+Space**" (autocomplete) is a good friend.
